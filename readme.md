**NIEM 4.0 (common) components in Java**

The National Information Exchange Model (NIEM) is a community-driven, common
vocabulary that enables efficient information exchange across diverse public
and private organizations. NIEM can save time and money by providing consistent,
reusable data terms and definitions and repeatable processes.

NIEM is distributed as a set of XML stylesheets (XSD) files.
This is a compilation of the complete NIEM 4.0 release.

**What is NIEM?**

Think of NIEM as a dictionary of agreed-upon terms, definitions, relationships,
and formats that are independent of how information is stored in individual
systems. The NIEM model includes community-specific elements, as well as core
elements that are commonly agreed to by the communities who use NIEM.
For example, common elements in the NIEM core include “person,” “location,”
“item,” “organization,” and “activity.”

**NIEM is a foundation to build information exchanges**

NIEM provides rules and methodologies around the use of the model as well as
a standardized Information Exchange Development Lifecycle that can be reused
by everyone.


# About this library

NIEM is a as a dictionary of data format. The utility of NIEM is that a subset of
dictionary "entries" can be encapsulated into a "package" and the package can
then be used to encode and exchange information in a standardized format.

NIEM also specifies a metadata strategy.

This is a compilation of the absolutely minimum NIEM 4.0 release, containing
ONLY the abstract metadata classes and absolutely NO implementation instances
identified in the NIEM "dictionary".

If you are building an application where efficiency and size are important then
this is probably the right resource for you to add NIEM metadata annotations
and object descriptions to your project.

# Versioning

The major and minor version of this library will always be "4.0" to indicate
compatibility with the underlying NIEM specification.
The patch version will be incremented as appropriate.
